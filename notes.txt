Hello! 6/28/24

We will be using Flask to make our API in python.

To set up Flask, type in the VS code terminal for Mac:

pip3 install flask

Now its time to create our flask application. Flask is the server that runs the API.

After we do the first initialization of everything, and create our first route, we can
run this. For Mac users, go in the VS terminal and type python3 main.py, or whatever
the file name is called. This will create a development server upon which you can
open it by right clicking the url given to you by the terminal. This should open
up a window with the route.

We just created our first route inside of a flask.
